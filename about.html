                <h2>My Journey</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a 26-year-old curious, trilingual lifelong student of design thinking, raised in
                    an academic family of engineers. My path to product design has been anything but linear.
                </p>

                <p>
                    With a background in computer engineering, I spent years building systems at The Linux
                    Foundation as a Google Summer of Code contributor and working with tech startups as a
                    DevOps engineer. I built secure OTA update systems, architected cloud infrastructure,
                    and automated deployment pipelines. The technical challenges were fascinating, but I
                    found myself increasingly drawn to a different question: <strong>Why?</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Why did users struggle with certain interfaces? Why did technically perfect products
                    fail to gain adoption? Why were we building features that nobody asked for? These
                    questions led me to pursue a <strong>Master's in Engineering Design with a
                    specialization in Product Design</strong> at McMaster University.

                <p>
                    This journey taught me that the best products emerge when you understand both what
                    users need <em>and</em> what's technically possible. I'm not an engineer pretending
                    to be a designer—I'm a designer with superpowers.

            <!-- Design Philosophy -->
            <section class="about-section philosophy">
                <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
                <div class="quote-box">
                    <p>
                        "The best solutions emerge when you deeply understand not just what users want,
                        but what they fear, and bridge that with what's technically possible."
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>I believe:</p>
                <ul class="belief-list">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Empathy drives innovation.</strong> Understanding user fears and pain points
                        is as important as understanding their desires.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Constraints spark creativity.</strong> Technical limitations, manufacturing
                        realities, and budget constraints aren't barriers—they're design parameters that
                        lead to elegant solutions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Process matters.</strong> Good design isn't about the final mockup—it's about
                        the research, iteration, testing, and learning that gets you there.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Design is a team sport.</strong> The best work happens when designers,
                        engineers, and stakeholders collaborate from day one.

                        <p>
                            I can read engineering specs, understand API documentation, and speak the
                            language of developers. When engineers say "that's not possible," I can
                            have a productive conversation about what <em>is</em> possible and design
                            accordingly.

                        <h3>User Advocacy</h3>
                        <p>
                            From conducting interviews with new parents for mental health platforms to
                            stress-testing espresso machine prototypes, I ensure user needs drive every
                            design decision. Research isn't a checkbox—it's the foundation.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Systems Thinking</h3>
                        <p>
                            Years in DevOps taught me to think in systems. I understand how components
                            interact, how changes cascade, and how to design for scale. Whether it's a
                            digital platform or a physical product, I consider the entire ecosystem.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Scrappy Execution</h3>
                        <p>
                            From prototyping espresso machines on 3D printers to building full Figma
                            prototypes with user testing, I move fast and iterate. I'm comfortable with
                            ambiguity and can ship MVPs that validate hypotheses quickly.

                <p>
                    When I'm not designing, you'll find me tinkering with espresso recipes (yes, the project
                    was personal), exploring new cities on foot, or diving into science fiction novels. I'm
                    trilingual (English, Hindi, Gujarati) and love connecting with people from diverse

                <p>
                    I'm also passionate about making design education more accessible. Having bridged the
                    gap from engineering to design myself, I know how intimidating that transition can feel.
