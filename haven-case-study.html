                        <strong>Almost 1 in 5 pregnant individuals experience mental health concerns.</strong>
                        Access to specialized care is limited by long waitlists, high costs, and stigma.
                        Low-resource communities face even greater barriers.

                    Current solutions—from sparse community resources to expensive therapy apps—fail to
                    address the specific needs of parents who rely on community centers and require anonymous,
                    accessible, evidence-based support without judgment or financial burden.

                <h2>Understanding the Problem: 4 Key Insights from Stakeholders</h2>

                <p>
                    We conducted comprehensive user research including interviews with expecting parents,
                    healthcare professionals, and social workers to understand the complex barriers preventing
                    access to perinatal mental health support.

                <h3>Research Methods</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>17 stakeholder interviews</strong> (parents, healthcare providers, social workers)</li>
                    <li><strong>Survey with 35+ respondents</strong> from community centers</li>

                <div class="insight-card">
                    <h4>1. Misconception & Mistrust</h4>
                    <blockquote>
                        "I was wondering if my body had failed me"
                        <cite>— Parent participant</cite>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Insight:</strong> Parents fear judgment from medical professionals.
                        The medical system focuses on baby's wellbeing, often neglecting mother's mental health.
                        This creates deep mistrust and prevents help-seeking behavior.
                    </p>
                    <p class="why-it-matters">
                        <strong>Design implication:</strong> Privacy and anonymity must be paramount to reduce
                        fear of judgment and encourage engagement.
                    </p>

                <div class="insight-card">
                    <h4>2. Peer Support is Critical</h4>
                    <blockquote>
                        "Peer support is 10/10 important to me"
                        <cite>— Parent participant</cite>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Insight:</strong> Community connection and long-term peer relationships are
                        more valuable than one-off professional consultations for sustained recovery. Parents
                        want to connect with others who truly understand their experience.

                    <p class="why-it-matters">
                        <strong>Design implication:</strong> Community features (forums, peer chat) should be

                    <p>
                        <strong>Insight:</strong> Low-resource communities need both physical and digital access
                        points. A digital-only solution excludes those with limited technology access or digital literacy.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Insight:</strong> Mental health recovery takes time. Crisis support alone isn't
                        enough—parents need sustained, ongoing resources and community connection throughout their journey.
                    </p>
                    <p class="why-it-matters">

                    Haven combines a privacy-first digital platform with physical pamphlets distributed in
                    community centers, ensuring accessibility for all regardless of digital literacy or access.

                <h3>Solution Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    The digital platform provides five core features designed to address the barriers identified
                    in our research. Physical pamphlets act as the entry point, distributed in places parents
                    already visit (community centers, clinics, libraries).

                        ready, they can opt-in to connect with healthcare providers through secure referrals.

                <div class="learning">
                    <h4>1. Designing for vulnerable populations requires privacy above all</h4>
                    <p>
                        The fear of judgment is real and rational. Every design decision—from anonymous access
                        to SHA-256 encryption—needed to prioritize privacy and user control. This isn't just
                        "nice to have," it's the foundation that makes everything else possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I learned that privacy-first design isn't about adding security features at the end—it's
                        about architecting the entire system around user control from day one.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="learning">
                    <h4>2. Stakeholder alignment is complex but essential</h4>
                    <p>
                        Healthcare professionals, social workers, and parents all have different—sometimes
                        conflicting—needs. The challenge was designing a solution that serves all three without
                        diluting the core value proposition.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I learned to facilitate difficult conversations about trade-offs and use data from user
                        research to drive consensus. When stakeholders disagree, bring it back to user needs.
                    </p>

                    <h4>3. Digital + physical works better than digital-only for low-resource communities</h4>
                    <p>
                        Our initial design was digital-only. Feedback from social workers revealed that many
                        target users have limited smartphone access or digital literacy. The physical pamphlet
                        was crucial for reaching those who need it most.

                    <p>
                        I learned that accessibility isn't just about WCAG compliance—it's about meeting users
                        in their actual context, which sometimes means going offline.

                    <h4>4. Business model planning is as important as UX design for real-world impact</h4>
                    <p>
                        The most beautiful design is useless if it can't be sustained. Spending time on the
                        business model, partnerships, and scalability pathway ensured Haven could actually be
                        implemented, not just prototyped.

                    <p>
                        I learned to think beyond the screen—good product design considers the entire ecosystem
                        needed to bring a solution to life and keep it alive.

                <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <p>
                    This project taught me that the best design emerges when you deeply understand not just what
                    users want, but what they fear. By prioritizing privacy, reducing stigma, and creating
                    genuinely inclusive spaces, we designed a platform that addresses the root causes of why
                    parents avoid seeking help.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Haven represents everything I value in product design: evidence-based decision making,
                    human-centered thinking, technical feasibility, and sustainable impact. It's the kind of
                    work that reminds me why I transitioned from engineering to design—to create solutions
                    that genuinely improve people's lives.
